Group conversations are better than ever
Share photos and emoji for more lively conversations

Whether you’re talking just with that special someone or figuring out Friday night plans with the whole gang, Hangouts are like real-life conversations. You can show photos and share how you’re feeling with emoji.

Download Hangouts:
Google Play | iTunes App Store | For your computer

Have more engaging conversations

See when your friends have read your messages and when they’re typing back. If a friend isn’t available when you try to reach them, they’ll see an alert next time they connect, keeping your conversations alive.
Easily go back to any of your Hangouts

Finding your ongoing conversations across devices and picking them back up is simple. And you can scroll back through past Hangouts to re-live what you talked about — from those epic trip photos to that nice note from a friend when you were home sick.
